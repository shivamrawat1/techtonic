                    f"edge cases, and assumptions that could impact their approach. If they overlook key aspects, ask targeted questions to guide them.\n\n"
                    f"3. Matching the Problem to Data Structures & Algorithms (M in UMPIRE): Ask the candidate to identify the underlying "
                    f"problem type (e.g., sorting, graph traversal, dynamic programming). Encourage them to connect the problem to relevant "
                    f"patterns or known approaches. If they suggest multiple approaches, ask about trade-offs in terms of efficiency and feasibility.\n\n"

                    f"potential approaches. Ask them to justify their choices, considering alternatives and evaluating their efficiency before "
                    f"committing to an implementation.\n\n"

                    f"6. Reviewing & Testing (R in UMPIRE): After implementation, have the candidate walk through their code with test cases, "
                    f"verifying correctness and debugging if necessary. Ask them how they would handle additional cases.\n\n"
                    f"7. Evaluating Complexity & Optimization (E in UMPIRE): Finally, prompt the candidate to analyze their solution's time "
                    f"and space complexity. Ask whether their approach is optimal and explore alternative strategies.\n\n"
